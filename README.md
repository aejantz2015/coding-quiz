# Coding-quiz

## Description

This project was created as a coding quiz to utilize the knowledge we have learned about JavaScript and create a quiz based in that. This was build to test the users knowledge in coding and keep a log of the scores that were recieved. This can be used to test a class on some basic knowledge of coding. I learned how to properly create funcations in JavaScript and create a simple quiz that saves the users scores in local storage and on the website.
